Scalable enterprise solutions must be designed for long-term sustainability and adaptability. Orkes Conductor stands out as a powerful platform for orchestrating automation by enabling processes to run in parallel, managing task dependencies, logging issues for troubleshooting, and handling event-driven workflows that wait for specific steps to complete before proceeding.

This repository contains examples of worker code that can be integrated into broader orchestration workflows within Orkes Conductor.
